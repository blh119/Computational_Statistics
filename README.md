# Computational_Statistics
Various Labs and Projects from Math 4672 - Computational Statistics. Most projects are done in SAS, but some in R. Every project includes a short write up and original code

Memo 4 - This lab is based on the paper Approximate is Better than "Exact" for Interval Estimation of Binomial
Proportions by Alan Agresti and Brent A. Coull (The American Statistician by American Statistical
Association, May 1998, Vol. 52, No. 2, p.119-126)
The coverage probability of a confidence interval (CI) is the actual probability that the interval contains
the true value of statistics interest

Memo 5 - Ordinary sample proportion for point estimation: pb = S/n; Adjusted Wald approximation for point estimation pe = (S + 2)/(n + 4); S is binomial S âˆ¼ Bin(n, p). Which is better exact of appoximate coverage?

Memo 6 - Macro to generate random data from a uniform distribution 

Memo 7 - A procedure for finding the best-fitting curve to a given set of points by minimizing the sum of the squares
of the errors (or offsets or residuals) of the points from the curve.

Memo 8 - Find the best-ftting curve for fish data, with linear, quadradic, cubic and spline models.
